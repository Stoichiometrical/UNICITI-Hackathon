 ### The Dataset
 # Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset

This dataset contains measurements of energy consumption in a house over a period of time, along with weather-related features such as temperature and humidity. The goal is to predict the energy consumption of appliances in the house based on these features.

## Features

The dataset contains the following features:

- `date` - date in format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`
- `Appliances` - energy consumption in Wh
- `lights` - energy consumption of light fixtures in the house in Wh
- `T1` - temperature in Celsius in kitchen area
- `RH_1` - humidity in kitchen area
- `T2` - temperature in Celsius in living room area
- `RH_2` - humidity in living room area
- `T3` - temperature in Celsius in laundry room area
- `RH_3` - humidity in laundry room area
- `T4` - temperature in Celsius in office room
- `RH_4` - humidity in office room
- `T5` - temperature in Celsius in bathroom
- `RH_5` - humidity in bathroom
- `T6` - temperature in Celsius outside the building (north side)
- `RH_6` - humidity outside the building (north side)
- `T7` - temperature in Celsius in ironing room
- `RH_7` - humidity in ironing room
- `T8` - temperature in Celsius in teenager room 2
- `RH_8` - humidity in teenager room 2
- `T9` - temperature in Celsius in parents room
- `RH_9` - humidity in parents room
- `T_out` - temperature outside in Celsius
- `Press_mm_hg` - pressure in mm Hg
- `RH_out` - humidity outside in %
